Surface wash only. --Peggy Etra Schweetheart is the most precious of primates. The tag reads 'Schweeheart the Beanie Baby has fabric that is tip dyed... only the very tips are dyed a separate color. It is a very costly and difficult process!' This Beanie Buddy (a larger version of the Beanie Baby) shows wonderful attention to detail: The body and head are brick-red with black; the hands (all four of them), ears, and muzzle are beige; and the eye area is tan. The effect is thoroughly realistic--from the light brown tuft on the head to the painted eyelids to the black thread mouth and nose. Schweetheart's shell is made from 100 percent Tylon, a Ty Inc. exclusive manmade fabric that has the most luxurious feel you'll ever find on a plush toy. Inside, he's made of polyester fiber and PE pellets in a cloth bag. Schweetheart makes a wonderful toy or addition to a collection. Surface wash only. --Peggy Etra"

Originally built as a monastic cathedral for Benedictine monks, Durham is the only cathedral in England to retain almost all of its Norman craftsmanship.
